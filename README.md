# You can create a variable as such:
a=5
# To print, you can simply use:
print(a)
# A variable can be modified, regardless of type
a='str'
# To create an array, you can do the following:
tab=[1,2,3]
# You can also create arrays of different types:
tab=[1,'mot',3]
# You can access a specific element in the array by using [i]
print(tab[0])
# You can use a for loop to iterate through the arrays:
for element in tab:
  print(element)
# You can also use if-else blocks similar to other languages:
if tab[0] == 1:
  print('Hello world')
# Indentation is used in python to create separate blocks, instead of the typical {}
for element in tab:
  if element == 1:
    print(element)
# Test
